Maven zip file uploaded on eclass , can import and run with additional path changes.


1. Clone this repository. The 2 project files UnisphereREST and EECS4413finalproject both have our code and will be insode 4413project folder.
2.  RUN the UnisphereREST using Tomcat 9.0. (backend)
3. RUN the EECS4413finalproject folder. (frontend)
4. The website should run.
5. Our SQLite .db file is inside unisphereREST project webapp folder
6. Images are already uploaded into project file, no need to change pathways. They should upload on their own.


**NOTE: --> Github code contains a few last minute fixes and will run better than the file submitted on e-class
